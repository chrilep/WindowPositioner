**Never move your windows manually again!**  
WindowPositioner lets you save and restore window positions automatically, optimizing your workflow.

## Overview

WindowPositioner helps you save window layouts according to your preferences and restore them whenever needed. Perfect for multi-monitor setups or frequently used applications you want always positioned just right.

- Save positions of arbitrary windows.
- Positions are stored in a JSON file inside your roaming AppData folder, ideal for user profiles.
- Automatic logging of actions and errors for easy debugging.
- Optional Windows startup to have the app ready immediately after login.

## Data Storage Location

Positions are saved under:  
`%APPDATA%\Lancer\WindowPositioner\positions.json`  
Example:  
`C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Lancer\WindowPositioner\positions.json`

The log file is located at:  
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lancer\WindowPositioner\log.txt`  
Example:  
`C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Lancer\WindowPositioner\log.txt`

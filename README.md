# WindowPositioner

Tired of moving around you windows to have the optimal layout for daily work? This app can store positions of windows and keep them in place.

The positions are saved to your roaming appdata folder. Eg. `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Lancer\WindowPositioner\positions.json`

The app writes a log for debugging purpose at local appdata. Eg. `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Lancer\WindowPositioner\log.txt`

## Ideas

When motivated and time available I may add this...

- [ ] Take screenshots of windows and add to the list
- [ ] Add some wildcard or regex support for window's title
